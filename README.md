# I Should Be Writing

Because you really should. 

![alt text](./isbw_screenshot.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Calculates how many pages you should be writing per day based on your current due dates and how much as been written.

Reads an `~/.isbw` file that is a JSON file structured like the following example: 

```json
{
    "projects": [
        {
            "name": "Chaucer Paper",
            "total": 20,
            "written": 14,
            "due": "November 1, 2017"
        },
        {
            "name": "Philosophy Term Paper",
            "total": 40,
            "written": 43,
            "due": "December 15, 2017"
        },
        {
            "name": "Conference Writeup",
            "total": 30,
            "written": 11,
            "due": "November 5, 2017"
        },
        {
            "name": "Dissertation",
            "total": 200,
            "written": 160,
            "due": "May 6, 2018"
        }
    ]
}
```

Can also be run from the command line with `--ascii` or no flags at all. 

```
%> python ./isbw.py
  Pages            Project
  -----            -------
[overdue]       Chaucer Paper
[finished]  Philosophy Term Paper
   9.50      Conference Writeup
   0.22         Dissertation

   9.72             Total
```
